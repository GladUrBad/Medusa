##############################

# Appearance configuration.
# If you want to change how Medusa looks, you can do it here.
appearance:

  # Theme system.
  # How to make theme:
  # Split the string with dollar sign symbol ($)
  # First, put the name of the Theme (Ex: Medusa)
  # Then, put $ and space after it (Ex: Medusa$ )
  #
  # After this, put the alert format and a $ after it,
  # followed by a space (Ex: &aMedusa » &f%player% &7failed &f%checkName% &7(x%vl%)$ )
  #
  # Then, put TWO (no more, no less, can be the same)
  # accent colours you want using the Minecraft colour code symbols (Ex: &a &c)
  #
  # Placeholders:
  # %player% - Player's name
  # %uuid% - Player's UUID
  # %checkName% - Name of the check (e.g. Reach, AutoClicker, KillAura, Speed, Fly)
  # %checkType% - ID of the check, just a letter like A, B, C.
  # %dev% - Experimental status of the check, if the check has a "*" after it, it's experimental.
  # %vl% - Current violation level of the check flagged.
  # %maxvl% - Maximum violation level of the check flagged.
  # %ping% - Latency of the player.
  # %tps% - TPS of the server.
