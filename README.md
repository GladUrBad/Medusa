# Medusa Anticheat
This anticheat (formerly known as AntiMoveHack) started because I got bored. 
Now, I've decided to make it a free anticheat on Spigot.
Medusa is very young, I started it late August 2020. As such, it will have lots of mistakes and lots of code for you to cringe at, just because I wanted to get something working for fun.

I will be adding some combat checks soon, and some better movement checks, as the current ones are quite lacking.
